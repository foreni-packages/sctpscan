  Copyright (C) 2009 Exception License Foundation

 Everybody is allowed to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
 document, but modifying it in any way is not allowed.
 .
  			    Preamble
 .
 Licenses for most software and projects used to take away your freedom to
 share and change them, until the "free" licenses were created. That enabled an 
 enormous quantity of free software and open projects to be created, developed, 
 maintained and expanded way beyond what one could have imagined in the 
 beginning. Internet and the contemporary world would not be what it is without 
 the contribution of so many people participating in the "Free, Libre and Open 
 Source" movement (FLOSS) as some have described it.
 .
 The original goal of FLOSS is a success, and now using and developing Open
 Source projects is a mark of smart thinking. In a perfect world, that would be
 a great common goal to use and change software freely, and collaborate in
 order to make the world more open and more diverse. In a perfect world, you
 wouldn't need an Exception License. We hope that this Exception License will
 be a sufficient message so that no further abuse are done, and be used more as
 an "art project example" or "theoretical or philosophical tool" for critical
 study of Open Source than a real license used in the real world. Sadly, we
 don't live in a perfect world and some uses are seen by the original Open
 Source Developers as abuses of their Open Source projects.
 .
 Some military equipment are naturally using Open Source, for some weapon 
 systems on ships and airplanes. Some missile may actually be running Linux. 
 Some open source database may be used to track population for ethnic 
 cleansing. Also, on a less dramatic but even more real note, some of the 
 people using Open Source are actually working to make it impossible to develop 
 through DRM, software patents, lobbying or Internet censorship.
 .
 Using Free, Libre and Open Source Software for some socially negative 
 activities can be seen as an unfair use of a tool for openness and justice. 
 The social cost of these negative activities is not covered by the people 
 committing such negative actions. Worse, Open Source software used for such 
 negative goals is indeed helping such negative projects, often against the own 
 will of the project developers, creators, maintainers and of the whole 
 community. The eGPL can be seen as a way to redistribute the social and human 
 cost of negative actions back to the original perpetrators of such negative  
 actions.
 .
 The goal of this license is then to enable the Open Source developers to 
 choose that their project be covered by an Open Source license, and yet retain 
 the right to exclude some entities from the right of using or modifying this 
 software under this license. In such case, the concerned entities should 
 request another licensing scheme from these Open Source developers in order to 
 use the software. The project team can define groups of Exceptions for its 
 project, and can even subscribe to "feeds" of exceptions that will define in  
 time the group of entities that cannot use the project under eGPL. These feeds 
 can be written by Non-Governmental Organization who know which entities have a 
 detrimental social and human impact. By having such list written, that can 
 help reducing the number of entities with detrimental effect on people and 
 societies, giving them strong incentives to cease negative actions.
 .
 Of course, the eGPL itself could be used as a tool in order to exclude 
 entities that do not have any negative impact. As a result, a few restrictions 
 apply to the eGPL. For example, you cannot define Exceptions on a specific 
 person or on an ethnic group. You can however define an Exception for a 
 Country or a Geographic region. Another condition is that the eGPL itself is 
 place under eGPL, creating the first recursive license known to us. The 
 Exception License Foundation will then pay attention to the use of the License 
 and revoke the right of using such license for a given project when abuse of 
 the original intent of the eGPL would be witnessed. For example, one could not 
 agree with an Exception that would prevent "All peace organizations of the 
 world" to use one particular Open Source project.
 .
 We protect your rights with three steps: (1) copyright the project or 
 software, (2) propose this license which gives legal permission to copy, 
 distribute and/or modify the software or project, (3) enable you to define for 
 your own project the list of exceptions, that is of entities that cannot use 
 this license and should seek another license for this project.
 .
 As with any Open Source license, there is no warranty for this free software. 
 If the software is modified by anyone else and then shared, the recipients 
 have to be aware that what they have is not the genuine, original software, so 
 that any issue due to someone else should not affect the original authors' 
 reputation. Also, people modifying the original project must be aware that 
 they cannot introduce new Exceptions, and that their Exception list is Exactly 
 the same as the original project. The reason behind this is that it would be 
 otherwise very easy for someone to take a project and slightly modify it, 
 create a new project, and then remove all the Exceptions from the new project, 
 therefore breaking the original authors intent.
 .
 Finally, as with traditional Open Source License, we state again the obvious 
 that all patents affecting a project or software must be licensed for 
 everyone's free use or not licensed at all .
